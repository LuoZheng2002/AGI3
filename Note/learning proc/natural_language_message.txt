The following is how to find the sum of two numbers.
For example, to find the sum of 1319 and 46, we do the following actions.
First, write the two numbers in the following format:

1319
  46

Then you find the sum of 9 and 6.
If you don't know how to do it,
you should first learn how to find the sum of two single digit numbers.
The sum of 9 and 6 is 15, so you write down the two digits like this:

1319
  46
  1
   5

Then you find the sum of 1 and 4, and you get 5.
Because there is a '1' under 1 and 4, you need to find the sum of 1 and 5, and you get 6.
Then you write down 6 like this:

1319
  46
  1
  65

Because there's no number under '3', you write down 3 directly like this:

1319
  46
  1
 365

The same reason applies to '1':

1319
  46
  1
1365

And 1365 is the final result.
